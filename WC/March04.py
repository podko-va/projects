### **Complexity Analysis**

Let N be the size of the input array.

- Time Complexity: O(N), since we only have 2 pointers, and both the pointers will traverse the array at most once.
- Space Complexity: O(1), since we are not using any extra space.

'''
A **happy number** is a number defined by the following process:

- Starting with any positive integer, replace the number by the sum of the squares of its digits.
- Repeat the process until the number equals 1 (where it will stay), or it **loops endlessly in a cycle**Â which does not include 1.
- Those numbers for which this process **ends in 1** are happy.

Return `true` *if* 'n` *is a happy number, and* `false` *if not*.
